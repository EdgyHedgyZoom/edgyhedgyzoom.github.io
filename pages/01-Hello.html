  <p class="mt-4">Hello! I'm just creating this post to introduce myself. As you can guess I'm EdgyHedgyZoom. Most times though I go by Pixelssaregood. </p>

  <p class="mt-4">My dream is to create my Casual Convo app. My plan is to slowly build and document this over a year or two. Im dissapointed that my estimate isn't lower but I have work and school to deal with. </p>

  <p class="mt-4">In the meantime, I also plan on contributing to some FOSS repositories soon. To be fair though, I don't believe my programming skills are good enough for most projects at the moment. </p>

  <p class="mt-4">But for now these are just words and plans until I put some work in. So hopefully I stick with this and acieve my dreams </p>
